# Hephaestus-Collections

This repository is a set of convenience methods for working on Java collections.
Some of this code is rather experimental in nature, whereas other parts have been moved here from existing projects.
However, regardless of the reason, my desire is to have well-tested and intuitive APIs.

First and foremost, this is a library for personal use. While many of these classes are practical, they are likely not powerful enough to justify as a third-party dependency.

Regardless, here are the highlights of this library:
 - **Iteration package**: This is a simplified version of a Stream that works on Iterables. This acts as an abstraction over simple for-each loops.
 - **Iterator package**: This is primarily for the creation for all kinds of Iterables and Iterators.
 - **Matrix package**: A highly opinionated implementation and set of operation for matrices.
 - **Base package**: A set of convenience methods for fundamental collections (Lists, Maps, Sets)
